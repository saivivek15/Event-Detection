The state Commissioner of Police, Chris Olakpe, who addressed the media on the attacks and sundry issues, said the police found the 'screaming' newspaper headlines mentioning 70 deaths to be way off the mark
"The figures presented, 70, cannot be objectively confirmed
We have 31 dead with their names and nine injured with names," Olakpe said, but objected to request by newsmen to release the names
Our correspondent reports that the casualty figure given by the police contrasts with that given by the Special Task Force (STF) which said Wednesday that the Task Force killed over 100 of the attackers
In his response to a question to that effect, Olakpe answered: "I cannot account for insurgents that were killed
We are talking about law-abiding citizens and as I have told you, their names and the names of the injured are here in our possession"
