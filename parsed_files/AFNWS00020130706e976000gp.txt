Survivors said some of the students were burned alive Saturday in the pre-dawn attack in Mamudo village in restive northeast Nigeria
One student said he was awakened at gunpoint, and suffered a gunshot wound that blew off four fingers of his right hand, his writing hand
Dozens more students fled into the bush, their fate unknown
The school is in a region where Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has declared a state of emergency and sent in troops to try to thwart militants fighting to create a breakaway Islamic state
But one father who lost two sons in the attack said the region is not safe
He said gunmen are attacking schools and "there is no protection for students despite all the soldiers." Authorities believe the attack was carried out by Boko Haram, an Islamist insurgent group whose name translates to "Western education is sacrilege."
