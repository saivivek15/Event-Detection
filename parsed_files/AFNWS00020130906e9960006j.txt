The incident occurred in Gajiram town, about 75 kilometres from Maiduguri, the state capital and the headquarters of Nganzai local government area and Buabilin Ngaura village of Konduga local government area, about 35 kilometres from Maiduguri
The sect also set ablaze police headquarters and a local government secretariat
An eyewitness, one Malam Modu Ngubdo, a resident of Gajiram town, told our correspondent that about 15 people were killed in Gajiram town yesterday night when persons suspected to be members of Boko Haram sect attacked the town
"They came at about 10pm and ransacked the town up until 2am before they left the town, holding the entire town hostage
"By 10am this morning (Thursday), most of the people who fled into the bush during the attack have not returned to Gajiram
I am worried and afraid
I don't think I can go back to Gajiram town now until normalcy returns," he said
Another eye witness, Malam Aisami Babagana, from Bulabilin Ngaura village, told journalists in Maiduguri that the sect's members attacked Bulabilin Ngaura village in the early hours of today (Thursday) and killed five people
"They invaded the village from nowhere
They just opened fire as they did recently in some villages in the same local government of Konduga where they killed many people
But here, they killed only five people going to mosque for prayers
"I believe that they attacked us because of how our volunteers have succeeded in curtailing their atrocities in our area," he said
The incident attracted the attention of the state commissioner of justice and attorney-general, Barrister Kaka Shehu Lawan, who went to Gajiram town to commiserate with the residents
The commissioner went in the company of the caretaker committee chairman of Nganzai local government and some senior police officers
All efforts to contact the JTF spokesman, Lt
Col Sagir Musa, and the police public relations officer (PPRO), DSP Jubrin Gideon were unsuccessful
However, one grains seller, Malam Goni Mala, a resident of Kasuwan Shanu in Maiduguri, said, "The incident actually took place on the market day of the town, Wednesday, when the people were buying and selling
"Some people from nowhere came into the market with guns and opened fire in the middle of the market
They were shooting sporadically in the afternoon, and people took to their heels on hearing the gunshots
But unfortunately, about 15 people lost their lives on the spot while many others sustained serious injuries
"They drove off before the military JTF or Civilian JTF could reach the scene," he said
