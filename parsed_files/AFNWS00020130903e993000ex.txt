LEADERSHIP investigation revealed that the gunmen stormed the village in the early hours of yesterday and opened fire on the victims
Our correspondent gathered that those killed were mostly women and children and they were all from two families
Confirming the sad incident, the Plateau State government said it had received reports of attacks on some communities in the state with great indignation
This was contained in a statement made available to LEADERSHIP and signed by the commissioner for information and communication, Pastor Yiljab Abraham
The statement reads in parts, "The unprovoked killing of six members of two families in their home in Kungte village, Kanadap (near Marraraban Jama'a) in Kuru District of Jos South local government area by gunmen yesterday , is an evil and wicked act that should be condemned by all members of society
"It is also a display of cowardice by the perpetrators who under the cover of darkness deliberately chose to visit violence on vulnerable members of society - women and children to achieve clearly devilish designs
Such an attack, coming at a time when the state has been mostly peaceful for quite sometime appears a desperate attempt to reverse the gains of our hard-earned efforts in breaking down the barriers of ethnic and religious intolerance and thereby rebuilding the bridges of communal consensus"
He said that such intentions would fail because the people of the state had made up their minds to live in peace with one another, adding that together with the state government and security agencies, every attempt aimed at taking the state back to the days of bloodshed and gloom would be frustrated
The statement further said that the government shared in the pains of victims and declared that those behind such acts would face justice in the long run
"We call on communities to remain alert always and work closely with security agencies in the sustenance of peace", it added
