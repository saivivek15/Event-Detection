The attack, it was gathered, was allegedly carried out on the village by a heavily armed gang from Tarok village in Plateau State
The gang, according to eye witnesses, stormed Tapga village in the afternoon and started attacking the residents, who were forced to flee their homes to take refuge in Ibo and Wukari
The Chairman, of Ibi Local Government Area, Alhaji Adamu Ishaku told THISDAY on phone, that three people were killed in the attack, though eyewitnesses said about five people were killed in the incident which left the entire community deserted
According to him, scores of people that sustained varying degrees of injuries in the attack were presently undergoing medications in various clinics in Wukari and Ibi local government areas
Confirming that the attackers are from Plateau State, Alhaji Adamu Ishaku, further disclosed the attackers took the villagers unawares adding that their plan was to "invade and attack Sarki-Kudu village of our council but they did not succeed in crossing the river so they ended up lunching an attack on Tapga village." The chairman, who could not ascertain the reason behind the attack, expressed sadness that due to the bad terrains leading to Tapga village, security operatives were not able to be drafted to the area to protect the lives and properties of the people
The security personnel, he said, complained that they could not reach the area except through the use of helicopter because the road is completely not motorable, especially in the raining season
He, however, revealed that Nahuta village, where the attackers had earlier laid ambush have been cordoned by security operatives, including Sarki-Kudu village
Efforts to reach the state Police Commissioner, Mr
Jubril Adeniji, proved abortive, while the mobile phone line of the command's Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr
Joseph Kwaji, was switched off
However, a senior police officer, who craved anonymity, told THISDAY that the command was on top of the situation, while appropriate measures had been taken to apprehend the attackers
