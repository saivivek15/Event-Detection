The raided village, called Adu, is an isolated community in Attakar chiefdom, about 10km from Attakar village which was attacked in April in a raid where several persons were also killed by unknown persons
Kaduna State Commissioner of Police Olufemi Adenaike, has confirmed the incident, saying the attack was a reprisal by the Fulani herdsmen
"It is a reprisal attack by the Fulani
The place of attack is an isolated place; it is an community about 10 kilometres from Attakar and the road is not motorable; that is why they decided to target the place
The attackers killed about seven persons, and it was an early morning raid." He, however, noted that, already, about five Fulani had been arrested and investigations ongoing
He warned residents again taking the law into their hands but to alert security operatives
In a reaction to the attack, a non-governmental organization (NGO), Centre for Development and Rights Advocacy (CDRA) has written a letter to Kaduna State Governor, Mukhtar Ramalan Yero, lamenting the inability to punish the killers
The letter signed by its spokesperson Dr John Danfulani said: "On each incidence, government comes out with hope gingering promise to fish out perpetrators and punish them in tandem with dictates of the law
Beyond those superficial tension cooling talks, nothing is done or heard until the next ugly incident is recorded
"Our bank of patience has gone red
And since government has consciously or otherwise fail to provide security to our people, we shall deploy the only option left on our table - which is, self help or attacking the attacker
And when that happens, we must not be viewed as evangelist of anomie but citizens struggling to survive from a genocide agenda set by their enemies."
