The gunmen, who were said to be heavily armed with sophisticated weapons, invaded the community at about 11am, shooting at everybody on sight
It was learnt that apart from the number of casualties recorded in the incident, several houses including other valuable materials worth millions of naira belonging to members of the local communities of Kuduku, Obasidoma and environs were destroyed in the attack
LEADERSHIP reports that the incident may not be unconnected with alleged attack on some Fulani herdsmen by unknown persons around Kuduku community
Efforts by security agents and the paramount ruler of Keana chiefdom, HRH Sen Emmanuel Elayo to bring the situation under control proved abortive
About 25 people from Keana town who were caught with stolen items belonging to the deserted farmers in the affected communities were paraded by security agents drafted to the area to maintain law and order, a day before the attack took
When contacted, police public relations officer of the Nasarawa State command, ASP Cornelius Ocholi said he was not aware of the incident, but pledged to inquire from the Divisional Police Officer, DPO in charge of Keana before commenting on the incident
