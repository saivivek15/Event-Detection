682 words 13 August 2013 01:33 All Africa AFNWS English Ed Daein, Aug 13, 2013 (Radio Dabanga/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Battles between the Rizeigat and Ma'alia tribes in East Darfur continued on Saturday and Sunday, rising the total casualty toll to 302 thus far
Meanwhile, the Shura Council (heads of communities) of the Ma'alia tribe is accusing the Rizeigat of "ethnic cleansing and forced deportation." Ahmed Mohamed Adud, East Darfur secretary-general, told Radio Dabanga that 106 members of the Rizegat tribe were killed and 111 were injured as of Sunday evening
He said Khartoum sent planes to transport the wounded from both tribes: the Rizeigat were transferred from Ed Daein to Nyala, South Darfur, and the Ma'alia from the nearby El Taweisha to the North Darfur localities of Klaimendo and El Fasher
Responding to rumours that a doctor was slaughtered in Nyala hospital on Sunday, Adub confirmed the killing but denied he was a doctor
"The Rizeigat killed a 'visitor' of the Gimr tribe who was taking photos of the dead and injured at the hospital." Although battles "on all fronts" have stopped on Monday, Adub said that schools, shops, and government institutions remained closed for a second consecutive day "in fear and anticipation of looting and plundering." Village torched: Sheikh Murdis Juma, Chairman of the Shura Council of the Ma'alia, told Radio Dabanga that 50 members of his tribe were killed and another 35 were injured
He added that many are still missing and that bodies and wounded persons had not yet been evacuated from the battlefield
Speaking to Radio Dabanga on Monday, the sheikh denied that government authorities had transferred wounded Ma'alia tribesmen to North Darfur
Juma further claimed that "Rizeigat militias torched the village of Dar Es Salaam in Abu Karinka locality on Monday"
"Ma'alia citizens and leaders in Adila and Abu Karinka refused to meet with the governor of East Darfur Abdul Hamid Musa Kasha, his chief of staff, and the minister of Wildlife Hasabo Mohamed Abdulrahman during their visit to Adila and Abu Karinka localities Monday," said the sheikh
While Ed Daein is generally accepted as the stronghold of the Rizeigat tribe, Adila and Abu Karinka are known to be the stronghold of the Ma'alia
Juma is demanding the central government to "sack Governor Kasha and appoint someone from the military instead to restore stability and security in the state." According to him, fighting between the two tribes broke out over land-use disputes in the areas of Keleikel and Abu Salama and not because of thefts and killings
"Both tribes held a four-day forum in Ed Daein two days before the Eid Al Fitr holidays to solve the issue of land disputes
However, the Rizeigat delegation refused to sign the agreement during the closing session, which led to the explosion of the situation." Border guards: An MP of Adila locality, Nour Al Daim Al Bushra, said in a press statement that border guards affiliated to the Rizeigat took part in the battles
"There is evidence to prove these claims, namely carts and vehicles belonging to the border guards that were found on the battlefield," he said
In reaction to accusations of the governor of East Darfur implicating the presence of Darfur rebel groups in the conflict, Al Bushra strongly denied any involvement from their part
'Ethnic cleansing' The Shura Council of the Ma'alia tribe claimed in a statement that the Rizeigat are practising "ethnic cleansing and forcibly deporting the Ma'alia from Ed Daein with the knowledge and complicity of the state government." "The Ma'alia want to be represented in a state's government other than East Darfur
We ask Khartoum to find a solution to this issue in the federal Constitution
We are boycotting the Rizeigat tribe politically, economically and socially," said the Shura
For their part, witnesses said the East Darfur population is "living in a state of extreme fear and terror." Schools, shops, and government institutions are still closed and transportation within and across states is compromised, they said
