Joshua Madit, the acting commissioner of Twic East county, said the attack occurred at about 6pm when pastoralists were gathering their animals in Alilei cattle camp in Maar Payam   district  
"Details are just coming in but I am told six people are killed," said Madit who declined to provide the identities of the dead
The commissioner said the stolen cows were driven towards the east of Jonglei, where South Sudan's army is fighting insurgents in Pibor county
Officials blamed Murle tribesmen of carrying out the attack but this could not be independently confirmed but witnesses claimed one attacker was killed and identified as a Murle
An eyewitness put the death toll at seven, a figure confirmed by Deng Dau, who represents Twic East county in South Sudan's national assembly in Juba
"A group of uniformed   men  , armed with heavy machinery, killed seven people," Dau told Sudan Tribune by phone from Juba
He said two of the dead are from neighbouring Jalle payam of Bor county and five from Maar of Twic East county
The motive of the attack was to kill people and take away the cattle, he said, adding that there is little hope to arrest the attackers or rescue the raided cattle due to heavy rains that had caused flooding and cut off most of villages from Jonglei's capital Bor
"There is a question of mobility," in terms of the police and army being able to respond to such incidents, according to the MP
Jonglei has experienced increasing cattle raiding and retaliatory attacks between rival ethnic groups since South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011
South Sudan officials say is aggravated by weapons left over from the civil war that ended in 2005 but also accuse neighbouring Sudan of supply arms to David Yauyau's rebellion
An allegation denied by Khartoum
A state-wide disarmament campaign was launched by South Sudan's president Salva Kiir in March 2012 but the effort has been marred by allegations of human rights abuses and, despite claims of some early successes, many groups have avoided handing over their weapons
Yauyau's rebellion, which is based in Pibor county, has complicated the recurring tribal tensions in the state
Last month a group of thousands of Luo Nuer men from neighbouring counties attacked areas of Pibor in response, they said, to repeated Murle raids on their territory
In the last few months rebel groups in Unity and Upper Nile state have accepted president Kiir's offer of an amnesty but Yauyau, who previously accepted an amnesty but returned to the bush to restart his rebellion in 2011, has asked that the United Nations act as mediators
The international community and religious leaders are currently trying to to restart peace negotiations
"All the peace loving people have been asked to accept   the presidential   amnesty
But the rebels are still attacking innocent civilians
If the UN is interested (in bringing peace to Jonglei state), then they should be persuading these outlaws who are trying to destabilize the area," Dau said when asked if the recent raid would jeopardise efforts to bring peace to Jonglei
