'The vigilante youths numbering over 100 were on a mission to capture some Boko Haram terrorists in their camps around Kaleri, Shuwari, Maganari and Nannari villages around Monguno local government area, before they were ambushed by the terrorists which led to the death of 24 vigilante youths, while about 36 were still missing," our source said
The Civilian-JTF are usually accompanied by soldiers when they go on their missions; but on that outing the soldiers did not arrive on time, PREMIUM TIMES learnt
"When the youths waited to see the arrival of military for some hours without response, they took courage to go ahead to the suspected terrorists' hideout
"But unknown to vigilante, the Boko Haram sects who disguised in Military Uniform with three patrol vehicles painted in military camouflage confused them thinking their escorts had arrived ahead
So, as they approached the men in uniform, unsuspectingly, and the terrorists opened fire and killed about 24 of the Civilian JTF," the source said while stating that about 36 of the youth were still missing The council chairman of Monguno, Muhammed Nur Monguno, declined to speak to journalists at the Government House, Maiduguri, when he visited to brief the state governor, Kashim Shettima, of the incident on Saturday
