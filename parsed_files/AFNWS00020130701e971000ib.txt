But the state police command and the Special Task Force (STF), have presented conflicting figures on the attacks in three villages of Langtang South local government area
Chris Olakpe the state commissioner of police said 10 people were killed on Thursday during the clash between Fulani hired militias and the peasant farmers of Bolgan, Karkashi and Magama villages of Langtang South Local Government Areas of the State and not 32 as reported by a section of the media
The STF also said 28 people were killed during the renewed clash which resorted in a gun duel between the attackers and the STF operatives leading to the killing of 20 of them
This is contained in a statement signed by the media and information officer, Captain Salisu Mustapha and made available to journalists in Jos
"This is to inform the general public and good people of Plateau State that on 27 June, 2013 at about 1:00am, suspected Fulani gunmen stormed and attacked Magama, Bolgan and Karkashi villages of Langtang South Local Government Area killing about 28 persons
"STF personnel went to the scene to bring the situation under control but the gunmen engaged them in gun duel that lasted several hours in the process, about 20 of the assailants were killed while some who sustained gunshot wounds were arrested, some motorcycles, weapons and ammunition also recovered
According to him, the attackers withdrew towards Yamini, Yalwa Shendam and Agikamai villages of Shendam local council area," the statement reads in part
However, the police boss said, four people were also injured and no arrest has been made so far while lamenting that the inflammatory report is capable of daunting the image of the state, which is fast regaining its place as the "home of peace and tourism"
