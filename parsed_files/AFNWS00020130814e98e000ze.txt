At least 44 worshippers were shot dead by suspected Boko Haram militants on August 11, 2013 at a mosque in Konduga town, some 35 km from the Borno State capital, Maiduguri, BBC reported yesterday, August 13, 2013
The killings in northeastern Nigeria took place during dawn prayers, but the news emerged late as communication was disrupted by the current state of emergency in the region
The gunmen attacked the mosque apparently in the belief that local vigilante group members were praying there, an official said
Thisday newspaper said a total of 60 people were killed between August 10 and 11, 2013 in Ngom, Maisarmari and Mailari in Konduga and Mafa Local Government Areas of Borno State by Boko Haram
The sect members were reportedly enraged that some residents were giving out information to the military that led to heavy casualties within the group
No single shot was fired by the attackers who were reportedly dressed in military and police fatigues
Reporting on the same incident, The Guardian newspaper of Nigeria said the throats of the victims were allegedly slit, thus evading the attention of security operatives
Confirming the separate incidents in Maiduguri, the spokesman of the Borno State Police Command, Gideon Jibrin, said three villages were attacked by armed hoodlums over the weekend, leaving no fewer than 31 people dead
He said no arrests were made either by the Joint Military Task Force, JTF or the police
In apparent response to the recent spate of attacks in Borno and Yobe States, President Goodluck Jonathan on Monday, August 12, 2013 in the capital, Abuja, met service chiefs and members of the cabinet
At the end of the meeting, none of the participants disclosed what was discussed
Meanwhile, Boko Haram's leader, Sheikh Abubakar Shekau, on Monday vowed to fight 'infidels' and the government until an Islamic State is established
After a lull in the wake of the declaration of a state of emergency last May in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States, there has been an increase in attacks blamed on Boko Haram
In order to curb them, vigilante groups have been set up in the three states with the support of the military
