Our correspondent gathered that at Ngom, a border town between Mafa and Konduga local government areas, the Boko Haram insurgents invaded it and allegedly shot 12 people dead on Saturday night
A resident of the area who ran to Maiduguri said the Boko Haram members stormed Konduga town early morning on Sunday during the Subhi prayers and opened fire on the congregation in different mosques, killing many of them in the process
A politician from the area who confirmed the death of 12 villagers said he learnt of another attack in Konduga where 40 people were killed
An official at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital confirmed to newsmen that 26 people who were brought to the hospital on Sunday were currently at the hospital receiving treatment from gunshots wounds
There have been no official statements yet on the incidents either from the Joint Task Force (JTF) or the police at press time, due to the Sallah break and lack of communication in the state
Suspected Boko Haram members had in the past launched attacks and killed many villagers whom they accused of being informants to security agencies and youth vigilante groups hunting for insurgents
About 45 people were killed in two separate villages in the state in July
JTF battles insurgents in sokoto, arrests wanted leader, recovers arms A week-long collaborative operation between the 1 Brigade Army, Sokoto, and the Department of State Security (DSS) has led to the arrest of a suspected Boko Haram leader, Mubarak (aka Dan Hajiya) and many members of the sect, army spokesman Capt

The arrest of the suspected leader of the group, which followed revelation from those arrested earlier, was said to have been carried out along Sokoto-Kebbi Road when the said sect leader was heading towards Sokoto to meet with his group
According to the army public relations officer, Capt
Musa, the security operatives were all successful in the series of operations carried out within the metropolis
He further disclosed that nobody was killed in the operation
The army spokesman, who addressed journalists yesterday on behalf of the brigade commander, Brig
Gen
Tas'iu Ibrahim, said the security operatives raided suspected insurgents' hideout at GidanIgwie and arrested some suspects
Capt
Musa said that the JTF further raided the house of the suspected leader of the sect (Mubarak) at the Lakasari area within the metropolis, and recovered a cache of arms
He said some of the weapons recovered from the operations include, three Ak-47 rifles, one riot gun, 153 rounds of 7.62mm, six 4-litre explosives, 21 prime explosive cylinders, 27 prime small tin cans of explosives, and three cartons of acid

Shekau claims responsibility for Yobe, Borno attacks The leader of the Boko Haram sect, Sheikh Abubakar Shekau, in an Eid-ul-Fitr Sallah message to his followers through video clip on Youtube monitored in Maiduguri, yesterday denied that he was killed
He also said none of his group's weapons and ammunition was seized by any military operative
He rather claimed that it was the JTF's equipment and facilities that the Boko Haram insurgents seized from them during their encounters
Shekau further insisted that the group will not accept the killing of their members in Bama, Gwoza, Malam Fatori, Damaturu, Gamboru and other places
He said, "All killings are for the sake of Islam
Killing is allowed but we don't kill children, Christians, old people, the physically challenged and females or women
We only kill the adults and young that refuse to accept Boko Haram." He swore that the group will continue to terrorise the country not only in the north or Borno State
"We are ever prepared to face the war
A lot has been said against us: that we are finished, they have finished with us
All these are lies
We are alive
Nobody killed us
And we shall continue to kill until Boko Haram is accepted by the people
So whether they tell you the truth or not, the truth will soon reveal itself as we are pursuing the course of God, not committing crime," he said
"So, whoever says what we are doing is un-Islamic, let him or her wait for Allah's judgement
God sees us and knows whatever we are doing
It is too late for Nigeria as a country to face us
We have people behind us supporting and our crusade
  Laughter   We are on the right path pursuing the right thing, not idol worshippers or otherwise and we shall continue to do that for the sake of our religion."
