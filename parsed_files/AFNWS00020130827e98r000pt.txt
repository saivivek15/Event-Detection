Locals said the gunmen invaded Agena and Agbaaye villages at about 8 pm on the fateful night and started shooting sporadically as they moved from house to house, maiming and killing their victims
The gang operated unhindered for four hours just as they set houses ablaze in the process, sources said
"The villages within Borikyo ward have been under the siege of armed robbers since March this year
Only in June, the robbers invaded one of the villages, Ayati, dispossessed their victims of valuables, killed one person and injured many others," one source said
"This time, when they attacked the two villages on Sunday night, they killed seven people in Agena and another four in Agbaaye
The other seven which brings the latest killing to 18." The villagers, the source added have now started deserting their homes for fear of another invasion since they could not ascertain the identity of their attackers
"We don't know who they are
Before now, they would rob us but this time, they did not rob anybody
So, we are confused and worried," he said
When contacted, the state police commissioner Adams Audu confirmed the incident but said the command would not speculate the numbers of casualties until investigations are concluded
