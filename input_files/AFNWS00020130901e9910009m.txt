The incident led to a reprisal attack by aggrieved youths, who stormed some parts of Bisichi village to rustle over 30 cows and burn a truck. Chairman of Barkin Ladi Local Government Area, Emmanuel Loman, confirmed the death of the travellers and said the incident occurred around 7:30 pm, while the victims were travelling from Bukuru to Foron. He said two of the victims were from Bwara, one from Kakpwis in Foron district and the others from Fan district, all in Barkin Ladi council. The factional Chairman of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) Plateau State, Isa Arzuka Jega, who resides in Bisichi, said the attack was carried out by suspected armed robbers, adding that some youths later stormed their village because they assumed that the attack was carried out by Fulani people. He said the youths burnt a truck and rustled some cattle but no one was killed. The STF Media and Information Officer, Captain Salisu Mustapha, confirmed that the attack was carried out by armed robbers, whom he said killed five of the travellers, while four sustained gunshot wounds and are receiving treatment at the Jos University Teaching Hospital.
