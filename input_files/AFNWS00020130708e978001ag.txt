According to sources, the entire Nzorov ward, Iyordye Akaahena village was razed by the invaders including the house of the former Benue state Head of Service, Mr. Mike Iyordye. The crisis is coming just few weeks after the feuding parties had agreed to lay down their arms and embrace peace. According to our source, the heavily armed invaders stormed the Tiv village Friday afternoon in a convoy of vehicles from neighbouring Nasarawa State, dressed in military camouflage uniforms. \"They stormed the village when most of our young men were in the farms; they leveraged on that to burn down the entire village after killing several persons which should be over 20 at the moment. \"Though we are yet to account for several persons because fighting is still going on at the moment, but people are already fleeing from the village in search of safe haven in neighbouring villages,\" the source said. When contacted, Guma Local Government Council Chairman, Mr. Frank Adii confirmed that at the time of filing this report, fighting was still raging in the village. \"From what I have gathered so far, the casualty figure is high with many injured but I am yet to confirm the number of deaths though I've already alerted security agencies of the development,\" he lamented.
