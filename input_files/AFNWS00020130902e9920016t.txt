It was gathered that the assailants, numbering over 30 stormed Amune, a small community not far from Buladimbam around 12 am last Monday. News of the attack broke only last night because of the difficult terrain and the cut-off of communication in the state. A native of the village, Madina Azaki, who is a freelance journalist based in Abuja, said all those killed in the incident were her relations, and that it was a targeted attack. A source in the village said the violence started when attackers killed one of the herders and whisked away another to an obscure camp located some kilometres away. Madina Azaki said a day after this, the herdsmen mobilised themselves and traced the footsteps of the attackers in order to rescue their abducted kinsman. \"When my people approached the camp of the attackers, they were ambushed which resulted in the death of 16 people. The victims include the district head of Amune, Ba Lamin, who was my uncle. His son Abdallah was also killed and we strongly believe that the killing was carefully planned. Most of the victims are extensively rich and have no fewer than 500 cows,\" she said. Madina said the killing marked the end of a generation in the settlement. \"The assailants have wiped away the village because they killed the bread winners. If you go there, you will only see women and young men who need help,\" she said. There was no information on the attack from the police and Joint Task Force (JTF) in Borno State.  ", "AGENCY": "NGA"}
